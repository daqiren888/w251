    "# Intro to Transducers\n",
    "\n",
    "By following the earlier tutorials for Automatic Speech Recognition in NeMo, one would have probably noticed that we always end up using [Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss](https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/) in order to train the model. Speech Recognition can be formulated in many different ways, and CTC is a more popular approach because it is a monotonic loss - an acoustic feature at timestep $t_1$ and $t_2$ will correspond to a target token at timestep $u_1$ and only then $u_2$. This monotonic property significantly simplifies the training of ASR models and speeds up convergence. However, it has certain drawbacks that we will discuss below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, ASR can be described as a sequence-to-sequence prediction task - the original sequence is an audio sequence (often transformed into mel spectrograms). The target sequence is a sequence of characters (or subword tokens). Attention models are capable of the same sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks. They can even perform better than CTC due to their autoregressive decoding. However, they lack certain inductive biases that can be leveraged to stabilize and speed up training (such as the monotonicity exhibited by the CTC loss). Furthermore, by design, attention models require the entire sequence to be available to align the sequence to the output, thereby preventing their use for streaming inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then comes the [Transducer Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3711). Proposed by Alex Graves, it aimed to resolve the issues in CTC loss while resolving the transcription accuracy issues by performing autoregressive decoding. \n",

    "## Drawbacks of Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)\n",
    "\n",
    "CTC is an excellent loss to train ASR models in a stable manner but comes with certain limitations on model design. If we presume speech recognition to be a sequence-to-sequence problem, let $T$ be the sequence length of the acoustic model's output, and let $U$ be the sequence length of the target text transcript (post tokenization, either as characters or subwords). \n",
    "\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "1) CTC imposes the limitation : $T \\ge U$. Normally, this assumption is naturally valid because $T$ is generally a lot longer than the final text transcription. However, there are many cases where this assumption fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Acoustic model performs downsampling to such a degree that $T \\ge U$. Why would we want to perform so much downsampling? For convolutions, longer sequences take more stride steps and more memory. For Attention-based models (say Conformer), there's a quadratic memory cost of computing the attention step in proportion to $T$. So more downsampling significantly helps relieve the memory requirements. There are ways to bypass this limitation, as discussed in the `ASR_with_Subword_Tokenization` notebook, but even that has limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The target sequence is generally very long. Think of languages such as German, which have very long translations for short English words. In the task of ASR, if there is more than 2x downsampling and character tokenization is used, the model will often fail to learn due to this CTC limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Tokens predicted by models which are trained with just CTC loss are assumed to be *conditionally independent*. This means that, unlike language models where *h*-*e*-*l*-*l* as input would probably predict *o* to complete *hello*, for CTC trained models - any character from the English alphabet has equal likelihood for prediction. So CTC trained models often have misspellings or missing tokens when transcribing the audio segment to text. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Since we often use the Word Error Rate (WER) metric when evaluating models, even a single misspelling contributes significantly to the \"word\" being incorrect. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To alleviate this issue, we have to resort to Beam Search via an external language model. While this often works and significantly improves transcription accuracy, it is a slow process and involves large N-gram or Neural language models. "

In the PyTorch specific implementation of CTC Loss, we can specify a flag `zero_infinity`, which explicitly checks for such cases, zeroes out the loss and the gradient if such a case occurs. The flag allows us to train a batch of samples where some samples may accidentally violate this limitation, but training will not halt, and gradients will not become NAN."

    "A model that seeks to use the Transducer loss is composed of three models that interact with each other. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Acoustic model** : This is nearly the same acoustic model used for CTC models. The output shape of these models is generally $(Batch, \\, T, \\, AM-Hidden)$. You will note that unlike for CTC, the output of the acoustic model is no longer passed through a decoder layer which would have the shape  $(Batch, \\, T, \\, Vocabulary + 1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Prediction / Decoder model** : The prediction model accepts a sequence of target tokens (in the case of ASR, text tokens) and is usually a causal auto-regressive model that is tasked with predicting some hidden feature dimension of shape $(Batch, \\, U, \\, Pred-Hidden)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Joint model** : This model accepts the outputs of the Acoustic model and the Prediction model and joins them to compute a joint probability distribution over the vocabulary space to compute the alignments from Acoustic sequence to Target sequence. The output of this model is of the shape $(Batch, \\, T, \\, U, \\, Vocabulary + 1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the transducer loss is computed on the output of the joint model, which computes the joint probability distribution of a target vocabulary token $v_{t, u}$ (for all $v \\in V$) being predicted given the acoustic feature at timestep $t \\le T$ and the prediction network features at timestep $u \\le U$.\n",

    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "1) It is a monotonic loss (similar to CTC). Monotonicity speeds up convergence and does not require auxiliary losses to stabilize training (which is required when using only attention-based loss for sequence-to-sequence training).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Autoregressive decoding enables the model to implicitly have a dependency between predicted tokens (the conditional independence assumption of CTC trained models is corrected). As such, missing characters or incorrect spellings are less frequent (but still exist since no model is perfect).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) It no longer has the $T \\ge U$ limitation that CTC imposed. This is because the total joint probability distribution is calculated now - mapping every acoustic timestep $t \\le T$ to one or more target timestep $u \\le U$. This means that for each timestep $t$, the model has at most $U$ tokens that it can predict, and therefore in the extreme case, it can predict a total of $T \\times U$ tokens!"

    "All of these benefits come with certain costs. As is (almost) always the case in machine learning, there is no free lunch. \n",
    "\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "1) During training, the Joint model is required to compute a joint matrix of shape $(Batch, \\, T, \\, U, \\, Vocabulary + 1)$. If you consider the value of these constants for a general dataset like Librispeech, $T \\sim 1600$, $U \\sim 450$ (with character encoding) and vocabulary $V \\sim 28+1$. Considering a batch size of 32, that total memory cost comes out to roughly **2.7 GB** at float precision. The model would also need another **2.7 GB** for the gradients. Of course, the model needs more memory still for the actual Acoustic model + Prediction model + their gradients. Note, however - this issue can be *partially* resolved with some simple tricks, which are discussed in the next tutorial. Also, this memory cost is no longer an issue during inference!\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Autoregressive decoding is slow. Much slower than CTC models, which require just a simple argmax of the output tensor. So while we do get superior transcription quality, we sacrifice decoding speed."

    "The most important component at the top level is the `strategy`. It can take one of many values:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) `greedy`: This is sample-level greedy decoding. It is generally exceptionally slow as each sample in the batch will be decoded independently. For publications, this should be used alongside batch size of 1 for exact results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) `greedy_batch`: This is the general default and should nearly match the `greedy` decoding scores (if the acoustic features are not affected by feature mixing in batch mode). Even for small batch sizes, this strategy is significantly faster than `greedy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) `beam`: Runs beam search with the implicit language model of the Prediction model. It will generally be quite slow, and might need some tuning of the beam size to get better transcriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) `tsd`: Time synchronous decoding. Please refer to the paper:                 [Alignment-Length Synchronous Decoding for RNN Transducer](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9053040) for details on the algorithm implemented. Time synchronous decoding (TSD) execution time grows by the factor T * max_symmetric_expansions. For longer sequences, T is greater and can therefore take a long time for beams to obtain good results. TSD also requires more memory to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) `alsd`: Alignment-length synchronous decoding. Please refer to the paper: [Alignment-Length Synchronous Decoding for RNN Transducer](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9053040) for details on the algorithm implemented. Alignment-length synchronous decoding (ALSD) execution time is faster than TSD, with a growth factor of T + U_max, where U_max is the maximum target length expected during execution. Generally, T + U_max < T * max_symmetric_expansions. However, ALSD beams are non-unique. Therefore it is required to use larger beam sizes to achieve the same (or close to the same) decoding accuracy as TSD. For a given decoding accuracy, it is possible to attain faster decoding via ALSD than TSD.\n",
